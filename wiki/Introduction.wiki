Weapons of Fury: Reloaded is a remake of the Weapons of Fury mod for Quake III Arena. The original Weapons of Fury mod appears to be lost from the face of the Internet. Therefor I took it upon myself to recreate the mod as a learning experience for Quake 3 modding.

This mod changes the rules of Quake 3 a bit. There are no weapons or ammo boxes in the map and everybody spawns with a Rocket Launcher with unlimited ammo. Whenever you make a frag, you're awarded a Plasmagun that will replace your Rocket Launcher. Making a frag with the Plasmagun awards you a Shotgun, and so on. Whenever you make a frag with the last weapon, the BFG, you are awarded 10 points instead of one. The catch, however, is that whenever you are fragged, you spawn again with the Rocket Launcher and you have to start all over again.

The code is also part of [http://www.theenginesofcreation.com/Content.aspx?id=other/myfirstmod a tutorial I wrote] for our website.

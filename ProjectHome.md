Weapons of Fury: Reloaded is a mod for the game Quake III Arena.

This mod changes the rules of Quake 3 a bit. There are no weapons or ammo boxes in the map and everybody spawns with a Rocket Launcher with unlimited ammo. Whenever you make a frag, you're awarded a Plasmagun that will replace your Rocket Launcher. Making a frag with the Plasmagun awards you a Shotgun, and so on. Whenever you make a frag with the last weapon, the BFG, you are awarded 10 points instead of one. The catch, however, is that whenever you are fragged, you spawn again with the Rocket Launcher and you have to start all over again.
